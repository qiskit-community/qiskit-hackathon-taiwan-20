# Qiskit Camp Asia 2019

## Things to do before the hackathon

Check the [`preparation&installation`](preparation%26installation.md) note for things to do before the hackathon

## I have an idea for the hackathon

Open an issue using the [`new project template`](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-asia-19/issues/new?assignees=&labels=members+wanted&template=new-project-template.md&title=Project+name) template.

Don't worry if your team is not complete yet.
Tag your project with `members wanted` and describe what kind of member are your searching for in the `Members` section.
At the beginning of the hackathon, the project should have no more than 5 members.

## My team is complete

Ask a Qiskit coach in the channel `#qiskit-camp-asia` (qiskit.slack.com) to remove the label `members wanted`.

## The project is ready. Let's hack!

After the project is defined and the team is complete, you can ask an IBMer in the channel `#qiskit-camp-asia` (qiskit.slack.com) to add the label `group ready`. This should happen before the group formation stage is finished, around noon of the first day. From this point on, you can use the issue to communicate progress as additional comments.

## The team needs a coach

A Qiskit coach guides and advices the team in its project.
Also will be your contact point after the hackathon, in case that the project have a continuation.
The team needs a coach before the final submission at the end of the hackathon.
